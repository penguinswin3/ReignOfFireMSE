# Reign of Fire - The Magic Set

This set aims to flesh out my TTRPG setting, focusing on the factions, themes, events, and characters surrounding the Reign of Fire campaign. Ultimately, this is based around a draft/limited environment, but some of the legends could be commanders for sure. 

While there are many individual factions with varying goals, motivations, and plans, this set reduces it down to 5 main groups, each representing one of the five colors. As complex factions, sometimes with overlap, each faction has two supporting colors, not following the strict wedge/shard paradigm. All colors, however, are balanced in quantity.

## Archetype Theory

This is a three color based set, with each color trio representing a particular faction. 

Each color trio can be split out between Vision, Values, and Means. It is important to note that there is often a contradiction in these themes, which is a core quandary we ask when evaluating these factions. This friction leads to the inherent conflict in the world and the drama within and between factions.

## Mechanical Themes

The primary draft archetypes are centered around the Primary Color theme, with one of the other themes supplimenting it. For example, The Heroes have Party as a primary mechanic, with either Legends or Sagas as a secondary mechanic. Naturally, it makes sense to bridge into the other option as well, more as a splash.

### The Heroes

#### Party

At the core of the adventurous hero faction, you have the tried and true party: Warrior, Wizard, Cleric, and Thief. The various (typically Human or Elf, sometimes Giant or Elemental) humanoid cards in these colors will almost always have one of the party creature types. You may find these in other colors as well, but usually without the mention of the party. 

#### Legends

Heroes are legendary, or at least the great ones are. In addition to being party members, Legendary creatures love supporting each other, either providing buffs, or recieving them better than others. A party of legendary creatures is a force to be recokened with. 

#### Sagas

Where heroic deeds are done, the tales of their triumphs are sure to follow. Heroes of old, while no longer around, are still remembered through the stories they made, for better or for worse. A party following the steps of the great heroes who came before them can learn from the victories and failures. 


### Cult of the Dragon

#### Toughness Matters

Being a secret cultist is hard, and that often means long periods of endurance and hardship. While often not on the attack, these cultist can stick around. 

#### Removing -1/-1 Counters

#### Disguise

### Gang Fusemont





### Ur Primalists





### Jyn Steyr








## Design Notes

Should the definition of party be expanded so that stuff like shaman and warlocks count as mages? 

### Cycle Goals

1 cycle at common
	
2 cycle at uncommon

3+ at rare/mythic rare

 A cycle of mana rocks at common (banners, signets, lockets, etc.) 
		CA6-CA10, Clasp cycle

Dual lands at common is smart (possibly one land in each pack)

  CL01-CL05, Landcycling cycle
  
Tri lands of some kind at uncommon

  Ul01-05, faction land cycle
  
Cycle of rare lands that produce 2+ colors



Fill in the rest of the set depending on the needs, but having a cycle of off-color activations at common is smart.


### Red Flags

//Use this when making commons, no more than 20% of commons should be red flagged
//See my NWO primer below for more details
http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/creativity/custom-card-creation/578926-primer-nwo-redflagging

Red Flag Reminders
- Does it affect other permanents?
- 4 or more lines of rules text?
- need to be read twice?
- Card advantage
- Multiple card kill
- Do you create a loop?
- Needed in numbers?
- rules issues
